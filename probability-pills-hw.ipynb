So there are less combinations and more permutations possible. If I want to choose 2 Coumadin pills from the 8 available, there are 8 ways to choose a first Coumadin pill and 7 ways to choose a second (because the first one has been picked and not available in the sample space anymore), and therefore 8 &times; 7 = 56 permutations of two Coumadin pills.
